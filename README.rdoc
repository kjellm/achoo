= Achoo - the Achivo CLI

Achoo is a command line interface for Achievo[http://achievo.org]. It
works by scraping achievo web pages and sending HTTP requests.

== INSTALL

These instructions are for installing on Ubuntu 9.10 (Karmic Koala),
but they will probably work with minor adjustments on other systems as
well.

- Make sure that you have ruby and rubygems installed

    sudo aptitude install ruby rubygems

- Install non-gem requirements

    sudo aptitude install ruby1.8-dev libxml2 libxml2-dev libxslt1 libxslt1-dev libopenssl-ruby

- Download achoo-0.2.gem[http://github.com/downloads/kjellm/achoo/achoo-0.2.gem] and install it

    wget http://github.com/downloads/kjellm/achoo/achoo-0.2.gem
    gem install achoo-0.2.gem

- Make sure that ~/.gem/ruby/1.8/bin is in your PATH environment variable

    if echo $PATH | grep -vq ~/.gem/ruby/1.8/bin; then
      export PATH=~/.gem/ruby/1.8/bin:$PATH
      echo 'export PATH=~/.gem/ruby/1.8/bin:$PATH' >> ~/.bashrc
    fi

=== TRACKING THE LATEST CHANGES

Requires git and rake

  sudo aptitude install rake git-core

Then

  git clone git://github.com/kjellm/achoo.git

Or if you already has cloned achoo, update with

  git pull

Generate gem and install it

  rake gem
  gem install pkg/achoo-XXX.gem

== USAGE

First, make sure that language in Achievo's user preferences is
English and theme is 'no value'.

Create ~/.achoo from the following template and edit it:

  RC = {
    :url      => 'https://example.com/achievo/',
    :user     => 'joe',
    :password => 'geheim',
    :vcs_dirs => ["#{ENV['HOME']}/projects"],
    :ical     => [{ :host => "foo.example.com",
                    :port => 443,
                    :path => "/joe/Calendar",
                    :user => "joe",
                    :pass => 'GeHeIm',
                  },
                 ],
  }
    
Then

  chmod 0600 ~/.achoo

You can then run achoo from a shell with the achoo command

  achoo
