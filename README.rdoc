= Achoo - the Achivo CLI

== INSTALL

These instructions are for installing on Ubuntu 9.10 (Karmic Koala),
but they will probably work with minor adjustments on other systems as
well.

- Make shure that you have ruby, rubygems, and git installed

    sudo aptitude install ruby rubygems git-core

- Install non-gem requirements

    sudo aptitude install ruby1.8-dev libxml2 libxml2-dev libxslt1 libxslt1-dev libopenssl-ruby

- Download achoo-0.1.gem[http://github.com/downloads/kjellm/achoo/achoo-0.1.gem] and install it

    wget http://github.com/downloads/kjellm/achoo/achoo-0.1.gem
    gem install achoo-0.1.gem


=== TRACKING THE LATEST CHANGES

  git clone git://github.com/kjellm/achoo.git

Or if you already has cloned achoo

  git pull

Then

  rake gem
  gem install pkg/achoo-XXX.gem

== USAGE

Create ~/.achoo from the following template and edit it:

  RC = {
    :url => 'https://example.com/achievo/',
    :user => 'joe',
    :password => 'geheim',
    :vcs_dirs => ["#{ENV['HOME']}/projects"],
  }

Then

  chmod 0600 ~/.achoo

You can then run achoo from a shell with the achoo command

  achoo


== TODO

- More input validation
- Better exception handling
- Add hour registration to a range of dates
- Subversion support (Bazaar, CVS, other?)
- Edit and delete registered hours
- Readline?
