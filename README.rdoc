= Achoo - the Achivo CLI

Achoo is a command line interface for Achievo[http://achievo.org]. It
works by scraping achievo web pages and sending HTTP requests.

== INSTALL

These instructions are for installing on Ubuntu but they will probably
work with minor adjustments on other systems as well.

I recommend using RVM (http://beginrescueend.com/). This enables you
to safely mess with ruby without messing with the system ruby. Achoo
is developed using ruby 1.9.3.

- Make sure that you have achoo's non-gem requirements installed:

    sudo aptitude install libxml2 libxml2-dev libxslt1 libxslt1-dev

- Install RVM

  Need to install some libs required to compile ruby

    sudo aptitude install build-essential libssl-dev libreadline6-dev

  (See http://beginrescueend.com/rvm/install/)

    bash < <(curl -s https://rvm.beginrescueend.com/install/rvm)
    # ... (follow the instructions for loading rvm into your shell's session)
    rvm install 1.9.3
    rvm use 1.9.3 --default

- Install Achoo

    gem install achoo


=== TRACKING THE LATEST CHANGES

Requires git

  sudo aptitude install git-core

Then

  git clone git://github.com/kjellm/achoo.git

Or if you already has cloned achoo, update with

  git pull

Generate gem and install it

== USAGE

First, make sure that language in Achievo's user preferences is
English and theme is 'no value'.

Create ~/.achoo from the following template (YAML) and edit it:

  ---
  :url      : 'https://example.com/achievo/'
  :user     : 'joe'
  :password : 'geheim'
  :vcs_dirs : ["/home/joe/projects"]
  :ical :
    - :url  : "https://foo.example.com/joe/Calendar"
      :user : "joe"
      :pass : 'GeHeIm'
   
Then

  chmod 0600 ~/.achoo

You can then run achoo from a shell with the achoo command

  achoo
