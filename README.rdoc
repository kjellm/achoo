= Achoo - the Achivo CLI

Achoo is a command line interface for Achievo[http://achievo.org]. It
works by scraping achievo web pages and sending HTTP requests.

== INSTALL

These instructions are for installing on Ubuntu 9.10 (Karmic Koala),
but they will probably work with minor adjustments on other systems as
well.

- Make sure that you have ruby and rubygems installed together with
  achoo's non-gem requirements:

    sudo aptitude install ruby rubygems ruby1.8-dev libxml2 \
      libxml2-dev libxslt1 libxslt1-dev libopenssl-ruby

- Install Achoo

    gem install achoo

- Make sure that ~/.gem/ruby/1.8/bin is in your PATH environment variable

    if echo $PATH | grep -vq ~/.gem/ruby/1.8/bin; then
      export PATH=~/.gem/ruby/1.8/bin:$PATH
      echo 'export PATH=~/.gem/ruby/1.8/bin:$PATH' >> ~/.bashrc
    fi

=== TRACKING THE LATEST CHANGES

Requires git

  sudo aptitude install git-core

Then

  git clone git://github.com/kjellm/achoo.git

Or if you already has cloned achoo, update with

  git pull

Generate gem and install it

  gem build achoo.gemspec
  gem install achoo-XXX.gem

== USAGE

First, make sure that language in Achievo's user preferences is
English and theme is 'no value'.

Create ~/.achoo from the following template (YAML) and edit it:

  ---
  :url      : 'https://example.com/achievo/'
  :user     : 'joe'
  :password : 'geheim'
  :vcs_dirs : ["/home/joe/projects"]
  :ical :
    - :host : "foo.example.com"
      :port : 443
      :path : "/joe/Calendar"
      :user : "joe"
      :pass : 'GeHeIm'
   
Then

  chmod 0600 ~/.achoo

You can then run achoo from a shell with the achoo command

  achoo
