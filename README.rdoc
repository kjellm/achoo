= Achoo - the Achivo CLI

== INSTALL

These instructions are for installing on Ubuntu 9.10 (Karmic Koala),
but they will probably work with minor adjustments on other systems as
well.

Make shure that you have ruby, rubygems, and git installed

  sudo aptitude install ruby rubygems git-core

Get Achoo

  git clone git://github.com/kjellm/achoo.git

Mechanize/Nokogiri requirements (nokogiri is required by mechanize)

  sudo aptitude install ruby1.8-dev libxml2 libxml2-dev libxslt1 libxslt1-dev libopenssl-ruby

Achoo needs bleeding edge mechanize (newer then 0.9.3) because of SSL
issues. 

  cd /tmp/
  git clone git://github.com/valo/mechanize.git
  cd mechanize
  gem build mechanize.gemspec
  gem install mechanize-*.gem

== USAGE

Create ~/.achoo from the following template and edit it:

  RC = {
    :url => 'https://example.com/achievo/',
    :user => 'joe',
    :password => 'geheim',
    :vcs_dirs => ["#{ENV['HOME']}/projects"],
  }

Then

  chmod 0600 ~/.achoo

Change to your achoo directory and run achoo with the following
command:

  RUBYOPT=rubygems ruby -Ilib achoo


== TODO

- Input validation
- Readline?
- Check date parsing (Chronic)
- Sane input defaults
- Add hour registration to a range of dates
- Subversion support
- Edit and delete registered hours
