= Achoo - the Achivo CLI

== INSTALL

These instructions are for installing on Ubuntu 9.10 (Karmic Koala),
but they will probably work with minor adjustments on other systems as
well.

Make shure that you have ruby, rubygems, and git installed

  sudo aptitude install ruby rubygems git-core

Install non-gem requirements

  sudo aptitude install ruby1.8-dev libxml2 libxml2-dev libxslt1 libxslt1-dev libopenssl-ruby

Download achoo-0.1.gem from http://github.com/kjellm/achoo/downloads and install it

  gem install achoo-0.1.gem

=== TRACKING THE LATEST CHANGES

  git clone git://github.com/kjellm/achoo.git

Or if you already has cloned achoo

  git pull

Then

  rake gem
  gem install pkg/achoo-XXX.gem

== USAGE

Create ~/.achoo from the following template and edit it:

  RC = {
    :url => 'https://example.com/achievo/',
    :user => 'joe',
    :password => 'geheim',
    :vcs_dirs => ["#{ENV['HOME']}/projects"],
  }

Then

  chmod 0600 ~/.achoo

Change to your achoo directory and run achoo with the following
command:

  RUBYOPT=rubygems ruby -Ilib achoo


== TODO

- Input validation
- Add hour registration to a range of dates
- Subversion support
- Edit and delete registered hours
- Readline?
